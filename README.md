Hi! I'm Random Kenzo, I made this account to post simple codes that I made in my free time, and  also, some of the answers to programming exercises.
I like to code random useless shit. My hobbies are watching random youtube recommendations, reading manga, playing games and drawing.
I'm currently learning python.
